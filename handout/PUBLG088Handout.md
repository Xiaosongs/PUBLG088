    PUBLG088 Advanced Quantitative Methods\

Overview and goals {#overview-and-goals .unnumbered}
==================

The course builds on the introductory level of statistics and
probability theory and introduces students to concepts and techniques
essential to the analysis of social science data. The goal of the course
is to teach students to understand and confidently apply various
statistical methods and research designs that are essential for modern
day data analysis. Students will also learn data analytic skills using a
statistical software package *R*. This combination provides students
with the skillset that is increasingly required by employers in today?s
highly competitive job market.

Prerequisites {#prerequisites .unnumbered}
=============

This is an advanced course intended for students who’ve already had some
training in quantitative methods for data analysis. The minimum
prerequisite is a good knowledge of linear regression models and
familiarity with a statistical software package (e.g., R, Stata, SPSS,
SAS, MATLAB). This would roughly be equivalent to having already taken
at least one module in introductory statistics and/or econometrics.

Before you take the course {#before-you-take-the-course .unnumbered}
==========================

You are strongly recommended before taking this course to complete the
following:

-   James, Witten, Hastie, and Tibshirani (2013) *Introduction to
    Statistical Learning with Applications in R*, Chapters 1-2.

-   *An Introduction to R*, available from
    <http://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/R-intro.pdf>

-   Downloading and installing RStudio, available from
    <http://www.rstudio.com>.

-   A brief online introduction to R Markdown, which we will use for
    completing the exercises for the course, see
    <http://bit.ly/R_markdown>

What to expect {#what-to-expect .unnumbered}
==============

Reading {#reading .unnumbered}
-------

The handout lists the required readings for every week. This required
reading should be completed prior to the lecture in a given week.
Students are expected to read the material very carefully. You may even
find it helpful to read it first, come to the lecture and then re-read
it after the lecture.

Homework {#homework .unnumbered}
--------

This is a methodological course, developing skills in understanding and
applying statistical methods. You can only learn statistics by doing
statistics and, therefore, the homework for this course is extensive,
including weekly homework assignments. The assignments consist of data
analytic tasks that you will be asked to complete either on your own or
in small groups. It is important to learn to work in small groups
because that’s how much of the private and public sector operates. You
may also be asked to present the results of your group work at the
subsequent seminar. This helps you develop public speaking skills and
skills of presentation of the results of your analysis to a wider
audience – something you’ll have to do in your job after finishing the
degree.

Homework and readings will keep you busy. But this is an intensive
advanced level course where we cover a lot of ground in ten weeks. So if
you take this course you shouldn’t expect an easy ride. However, skills
you learn in the course are transferrable well beyond your degree.

Assessment {#assessment .unnumbered}
==========

The course is assessed with a 3,000-word research paper in the form of a
replication assignment (100% of the mark for the course). The goal of
the research paper is to help you develop a deeper understanding of data
analytic methods in your field of study and ability to apply them to a
concrete empirical problem.

1.  Your paper should address a substantive problem in your field
    of interest.

2.  We will discuss the basic principles of replication and your essay
    assignment before the Reading Week, giving you an opportunity to
    work on the project during the Reading Week.

3.  The research paper should replicate an academic article published in
    the last 5-8 years in a top ranking political science or
    economics journal. The definition of top ranking is any of the top
    20 journals from the Google Scholar rankings:

    -   Political Science: <http://bit.ly/GoogleScholar_PoliSci>

    -   Economics: <http://bit.ly/GoogleScholar_Economics>

    Higher quality articles tend to appear in higher ranked journals,
    and in your replication exercise you should be learning from
    the best. Also, the number of citations of an article on Google
    Scholar is an indicator of its importance to the discipline.

4.  Your paper must use methods we have or will talk about in the
    course, or at about the same level of sophistication as the material
    we cover here.

5.  You don’t need to replicate every section in the original article.
    You can replicate only the part that you can justify as important
    (this may not be the part that the author considered important).

6.  Do not choose an article unless you fully understand its argument,
    methods, and substance.

7.  Your key task for the assignment is to improve and extend the
    analysis in one specific area. This should be reflected in your
    paper structure: replication of the original result should not take
    up more than a page or two of your paper, main emphasis should be on
    the substantive contribution and extension of the original results
    that you are making.

8.  Improvements can include changing the way the original article dealt
    with missing data, selection bias, omitted variable bias, the model
    specification, the functional form, adding control variables or
    better measures, extending the time series and conducting
    out-of-sample tests, applying a better statistical model, etc.

9.  By 10am in Week 10 upload a 2-page proposal outlining a clear
    replication and improvement plan to the corresponding folder on the
    Moodle page for the course. Your proposal should have a max 200-word
    abstract (just like any journal article that you read) that contains
    a sentence on how replicating this article will help you with your
    dissertation project. In our Week 10 seminar we’ll discuss
    your proposals.

10. Your paper should be proofread. Follow Harvard referencing style,
    using the citation style of the American Political Science Review.

11. This assignment is a version of the replication paper exercise at
    Gary King’s Gov2001 course at Harvard. For more details and guidance
    read Gary King “Publication, Publication,” *PS: Political Science
    and Politics*, Vol. 39, No. 1 (January, 2006), 119-125. Updates are
    available here: <http://gking.harvard.edu/papers/>.

12. Follow Gary King’s discussion in “Publication, Publication” for
    overall style, structure, and presentation of your paper.

13. Good examples of a replication exercise are (a) Gary King and
    Michael Laver “On Party Platforms, Mandates, and Government
    Spending” *American Political Science Review*; and (b) Bell, Mark
    and N. Miller “Questioning the Effect of Nuclear Weapons on
    Conflict” *Journal of Conflict Resolution*.

14. You should use R Markdown to write your replication project.

15. The final version of the paper is due on <span> 14 January
    2016</span>. For the PUBLG088 course, only an online submission
    is required. Please ensure you read the documents in the essay
    information folder on Moodle page for the course for full details on
    how to complete the submission. In addition you must also upload
    your complete replication package (R Markdown .Rmd file and full
    replication set) to the corresponding folder on Moodle.

The mark for your assessment consists of two parts: replication (50%)
and extension (50%). The marks for replication and extension reflect how
well you address points in the assessment description above.
